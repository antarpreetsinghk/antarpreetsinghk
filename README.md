# 👋 Hi, I’m **Antarpreet Kauldhar**

**Backend Architect | High-Efficiency Systems | Agri-Tech Specialist**

I bridge the gap between complex software engineering and the physical world of **Precision Agriculture**. With **8+ years of experience**, I specialize in building backend systems where every millisecond and every dollar of infrastructure spend counts.

My core philosophy is **Progressive Fallback**: prioritizing lean, native logic to achieve maximum performance and zero waste before layering in complex AI/LLM dependencies.

## 🚜 Agri-Tech & Precision Agriculture Focus
As the industry moves toward autonomous "Smart Farms," I provide the backend stability required for real-time operations:
- **Low-Latency Architecture:** Optimizing data pipelines for real-time sensor and equipment feedback.
- **Infrastructure Sustainability:** Reducing operational costs to make digital farming affordable for producers.
- **Reliability:** Engineering "always-on" systems for critical seasonal windows (planting/harvesting).

## 🚀 Featured Case Study: **Bella Voice Booking Engine**
*Production Voice-AI Platform | Performance Optimized (2025–2026)*

**The Problem:** Small businesses and service providers lose significant revenue to missed calls but can't afford the latency or cost of standard LLM-based voice bots.

**The Solution:** A high-concurrency voice engine built on the **Progressive Fallback** model.
- ⚡ **200x Speed Boost:** Optimized core logic to reduce response latency from **2000ms → 10ms**.
- 💰 **100% Cost Efficiency:** Eliminated monthly AI API costs ($150/mo → $0) by replacing redundant LLM calls with lean Python logic.
- 🗣 **Real-World Integration:** Accent-optimized STT for Canadian regions with live Google Calendar sync.
- 🛠 **Stack:** FastAPI, Async SQLAlchemy 2.0, Redis, AWS (EC2, ECR, RDS), Docker.
